        one page only as long as the resource will be used only in that page. We do this by calling the resources of the page. Example for a page
        called history page, we define it <HistoryPage.Resources> and then call the resource dictionary. Not so hard-->

            The section below shows the use of implicit styles.  It is declared like this
            This section will only work iff there is no definition of the button style in the button's page.
            For explicit sytle declaration, i.e if we want the style to apply
            to only some chosen target types, all we have to do is declare a key in the style. eg "x:key="normal" and then call the "<style = "{StaticResource normal}" 
            at the target page itself.
